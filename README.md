# Digital Voting Process
Firstly we required connect our Voter ID with Aadhaar card .<br/>
There may be any application or WebApplication which access you Voter ID as well as Aadhaar Card.<br/>
Actually meaning of this line is to interlink of Aadhaar Card and Voter ID.<br/>
As Aadhaar card having fingerprints of that person then only that person can vote using that voter ID or Aadhaar Card.<br/>
As this is online Process so it save lot of time of peoples.<br/>

Second thing is ....<br/>

Every citizen has an ID that has fingerprints in it.<br/>
And there is one Voter ID.<br/>
These both can be interlinked .<br/>
So when we goes for voting we have to select that Person to whom we want to votes but final submission is with your fingerprints. <br/>
These firgerprints compared with that of original fingerprints of that Person whose this ID is.<br/>

If you get true then your vote is submmitted otherwise rejected.<br/>

Third thing is .....<br/>
We can create an application that have access over Biometric ID and Voter ID .<br/>
This application and you create a link between both of your IDs<br/>
When voting days coming that open the list of nominee and you have to select your candidate and proceeded for vote submission .<br/>
There is no altration in choosen candidate for your vote after submission of vote .<br/>
